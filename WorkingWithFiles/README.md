##Working With Files

**AlphabetizedNames:** Using System.IO.File class, retrieve a .txt file containing 5,163 random names and sort them in a list in alphabetical order and save to a new file. Then calculate name scores by computing alphabetical value of each name in list and multiplying that by its position in list. Create new .txt file with all name scores and calculate total of all name scores to display to console.

**LargeNumsArray:** Retrieve longnums.txt file which contains 100 random numbers (each 50 digits long) from resources directory and sort according to size (smallest numbers first) then save results to new file called p5a.txt in answers directory. Get the sum of all numbers and print the first 10 digits to the console.
