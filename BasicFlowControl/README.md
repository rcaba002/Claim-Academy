##Basic Flow Control

This folder contains two basic C# web applications:

**CheckPassFail:** Using an if/else statement, prints the word "PASS" to the console if the variable 'mark' is more than or equal to 50 and prints "FAIL" otherwise.

**PrintNumberInWord:** Showcasing the use of methods, arrays, dictionaries, nested-if statements, and switch statements, this app prints the word form of a number 0-100.
