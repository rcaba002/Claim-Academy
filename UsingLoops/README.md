##Using Loops

This folder contains two C# console applications that focuses on using different loops:

**SumAndAverage:** This program contains a method that adds numbers and a method that calculates the average. It uses the following:
- System.Math class
- while loops
- % operator
- counter variables

**CozaLozaWoza:** Using loops and conditions, prints a list of numbers to the console, replacing any multiples of 3 with the word "Coza", multiples of 5 with "Loza", multiples of 7 with "Woza", multiples of 3 and 5 with "CozaLoza", and so on.
