##Using Loops

**SumAndAverage:** Contains methods that take an integer array and returns the following:
- sum of all numbers
- average of all numbers
- only the odd numbers
- only numbers divisble by seven
- square of each number

**CozaLozaWoza:** Using loops and conditions, prints a list of numbers to the console, replacing any multiples of 3 with the word "Coza", multiples of 5 with "Loza", multiples of 7 with "Woza", multiples of 3 and 5 with "CozaLoza", and so on.
